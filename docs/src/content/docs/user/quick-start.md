`capo.js` is a tool for assessing the quality of the document `<head>`. You can run it in your browser as a Chrome extension or DevTools snippet, in a testing environment like WebPageTest, or an analytical datastore like BigQuery.

An unoptimized `<head>` can lead to poor performance and a poor user experience. `capo.js` can help you identify and fix these issues.
