This tool was directly inspired by [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry)' work on [ct.css](https://csswizardry.com/ct/) and [Vitaly Friedman](https://twitter.com/vitalyf)'s [2022 presentation](https://youtu.be/uqLl-Yew2o8?t=2873) at Nord.

Capo.js is a tool for assessing the quality of the document `<head>`. You can run it in your browser as a Chrome extension or DevTools snippet, in a testing environment like WebPageTest, or analytical datastore like BigQuery.

An unoptimized `<head>` can lead to poor performance and a poor user experience. Capo.js can help you identify and fix these issues.
