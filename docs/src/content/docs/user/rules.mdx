Elements are categorized into 11 groups. Each group has an associated weight to determine the optimal sort order. Elements within the same group are considered equal weight and displayed in the order they're found in the document.

## <InlineCapoWeightBars weight="11" /> 11. Pragma directives

Pragma directives are the highest weighted elements in capo.js. They tell the browser how to parse or handle the document, so they must be discovered **as early as possible** to avoid race conditions with other content.

### `<meta http-equiv>`

The `http-equiv` meta tag is used to set directives equivalent to HTTP headers.

Most HTTP headers are [unsupported keywords](https://rviscomi.dev/2023/07/you-probably-dont-need-http-equiv-meta-tags/) for the `http-equiv` attribute, so capo.js only recognizes a few of them:

- `default-style`
- `x-dns-prefetch-control`
- `accept-ch`
- `delegate-ch`
- `content-security-policy`
- `origin-trial`
- `content-type`

Some keywords like `refresh` are standardized and widely supported by browsers, but capo.js does not weigh them as highly as other `http-equiv` directives because it's not strictly necessary for them to be placed in the top position.

#### `default-style`

:::caution[Obsoletion warning]
capo.js discourages using this keyword in favor of modern CSS alternatives. However, in cases where the keyword _must_ be used, capo.js recommends placing it in the top position.
:::

[`default-style`](https://rviscomi.dev/2023/07/you-probably-dont-need-http-equiv-meta-tags/#default-style) is an obscure-yet-valid keyword that tells the browser which [alternate stylesheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Alternative_style_sheets) to use as the preferred default.

This declaration should come before any stylesheets that may need to be enabled.

#### `x-dns-prefetch-control`

[`x-dns-prefetch-control`](https://rviscomi.dev/2023/07/you-probably-dont-need-http-equiv-meta-tags/#x-dns-prefetch-control) is a non-standard keyword that tells the browser whether to perform DNS prefetching on the page.

Its only legitimate use is to disable prefetching, so when it's present, capo.js recommends placing it in the top position before any DNS lookups occur.

#### `accept-ch`

[`accept-ch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-CHs) is a non-standard keyword that tells the browser which client hints to send back to the server.

This declaration should be set before any subresource requests are made to the origin, so capo.js recommends placing it in the top position.

#### `delegate-ch`

[`delegate-ch`](https://github.com/WICG/client-hints-infrastructure#delegate-ch) is a non-standard keyword that tells the browser which client hints may be delegated to third party origins.

#### `content-security-policy`

:::caution[Performance warning]
Due to a known [performance bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1458493), capo.js discourages using this keyword in favor of its HTTP header alternative. However, in cases where the keyword _must_ be used, capo.js recommends placing it in the top position.
:::

[`content-security-policy`](https://rviscomi.dev/2023/07/you-probably-dont-need-http-equiv-meta-tags/#content-security-policy) is a non-standard keyword that provides the browser with a security policy to use on the page.

To effectively mitigate all possible security risks, this declaration should be set before any resource content, so capo.js recommends placing it in the top position.

#### `origin-trial`

`origin-trial` is a non-standard keyword that allows developers to test new web platform features on a per-origin basis.

See [origin trial validation](/capo.js/user/validation/#no-invalid-origin-trials) for more information about how capo.js validates origin trial tokens.

Because origin trials have the potential to influence how the browser behaves, capo.js recommends placing this declaration in the top position.

#### `content-type`

:::caution[Obsoletion warning]
capo.js discourages using this keyword in favor of the [`charset`](#meta-charset) meta tag or `Content-Type` HTTP header. However, in cases where the keyword _must_ be used, capo.js recommends placing it in the top position.
:::

[`content-type`](https://rviscomi.dev/2023/07/you-probably-dont-need-http-equiv-meta-tags/#content-type) is a standard keyword that defines the character encoding for the page.

See [`<meta charset>`](#meta-charset) for more information about why this declaration should be placed in the top position.

### `<meta charset>`

Every page must declare a character encoding of `UTF-8`, using either the `charset` meta tag or the `Content-Type` HTTP response header. When the meta tag is used, it must be discoverable within the first 1024 bytes of the document.

To avoid encoding issues with user-visible content like the `<title>` element, capo.js recommends placing this declaration in top position.

### `<meta name=viewport>`

### `<base>`

The `base` element sets the base URL for all relative URLs in the document.

To avoid any broken links for resources loaded early in the document, capo.js recommends placing the `<base>` element in the top position.
